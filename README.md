# JuliaNotes

A collection of explanations and tips to make the best use of `Julia`.
Many answers are extracts from solutions provided to user questions in
the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org). 

The only thing to read here is the 
[Documentation](https://m3g.github.io/JuliaNotes.jl/stable/).
