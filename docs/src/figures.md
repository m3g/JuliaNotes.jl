# Some tips to produce beautiful plots with Plots and LaTeX

When using `Plots`, in particular in combination with the `LaTeXStrings` package, some tips can help one to obtain nice-looking fonts.

1. Use `LaTeXStrings` to produce subscripts, math, etc.
2. Set all fonts to `ComputerModern` by default. 
3. Adjust plot size. 

## LaTeX fonts

Some other options, as `linewidth`, `framestyle`, are a matter of taste. Here I use what I usually prefer. 

```julia
using Plots
using LaTeXStrings
plot_font = "Computer Modern"
default(
    fontfamily=plot_font,
    linewidth=2, 
    framestyle=:box, 
    label=nothing, 
    grid=false
)
plot(sort(rand(10)),sort(rand(10)),label="Legend")
plot!(xlabel=L"\textrm{Standard~text}(r) / \mathrm{cm^3}")
plot!(ylabel="Same font as everything")
annotate!(0.5,0.8,text("My note",plot_font,12))
```

This will produce a figure with homogeneous fonts:

```@raw html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3g/JuliaNotes.jl/main/docs/src/assets/plot1.png">
```
The font of annotations must be set explicitly, as in the example, for each annotation (they do not inherit the `default` font).

The use of `\textrm` or `\mathrm`, which should provide the same results, must be tested, because of an [an issue with TeX rendering by GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl/issues/402). Also, sometimes it is necessary to add `~` to represent spaces in `\textrm{}` blocks, as in the example. 

## Font, margin, and figure size

The font and figure sizes can be tuned using some parameters, for instance, `scalefontsizes`:

```julia
scalefontsizes(1.3)
plot(sort(rand(10)),sort(rand(10)),label="Legend")
plot!(xlabel=L"\textrm{Standard~text}(r) / \mathrm{cm^3}")
plot!(ylabel="Same font as everything")
annotate!(0.5,0.8,text("My note",plot_font,12))
```

Which will produce this figure:

```@raw html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3g/JuliaNotes.jl/main/docs/src/assets/plot2.png">
```

To control the margins, because sometimes depending on the font and figure sizes the labels might be cut, set margins (as in the example), which to be set practically need the explicit import of `Plots.Measures`, and perhaps play a little with the size (`size` parameter) of the figure. For example:

```julia
using Plots, Plots.Measures, LaTeXStrings
plot_font = "Computer Modern"
default(
    fontfamily=plot_font,
    linewidth=2, 
    framestyle=:box, 
    label=nothing, 
    grid=false
)
scalefontsizes(1.5)
plot(sort(rand(10)),sort(rand(10)),label="Legend")
plot!(xlabel=L"\textrm{Standard~text}(r) / \mathrm{cm^3}")
plot!(ylabel="Same font as everything")
annotate!(0.5,0.8,text("My note",plot_font,12))
plot!(margin=(5mm),size=(500,400))
```
will produce:

```@raw html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3g/JuliaNotes.jl/main/docs/src/assets/plot3.png">
```

## Save as PDF, convert afterwards

As a reasonable strategy, it is practical to save the plot to a pdf file, with 
```julia
savefig("./plot.pdf")
```
and convert it later to other formats (`png`, `tiff`, etc), with, for example GIMP. PDF are scalable vector graphics, thus the resolution will be defined only on the conversion step. Additionally, PDF viewers update the file when it is modified, thus one can tune the figure properties by changing the plot generation and viewing the PDF directly, which we will be sure will conform the final figure appearance.
